            <h1 class="p2-quote">I was born on the east coast raised in western Washington State, many places between
                 Seattle down to Olympia. I live with my girlfriend in south Seattle. Together we own a total of eight 
                 pet pigeons, she owns six and I have two. I am currently working in a warehouse and take care of dogs
                  during my off time. Im excited to continue moving forward in the Self-Paced program and really look
                 forward to the challenges in the bootcamp and the software engineering field.
